# Bramz_Bot
Bramz_Bot is a chat bot for my [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/Bramz).

## Usage
To use the bot, you must install [TMI.js](https://github.com/tmijs/tmi.js). Read their [documentation](https://github.com/tmijs/docs/tree/gh-pages/_posts) for more info.  
Additionally, you must replace `identity.username` and `identity.password` with the username and oauth token for the account you'd like your bot to message from. You can get this token using [this](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) tool. I used `dotenv` to hide my bot's information.

## Config
You can change values in `config.js` to your liking. Read the comments in that file to learn about them.
